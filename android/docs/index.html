  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: <strong>9 June 2025</strong></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Track Expense</strong> ("<em>we</em>", "<em>our</em>", or "<em>us</em>") is a
    local-only Android app (“<em>the App</em>”) that helps you record and track business expenses.
    This Privacy Policy explains what data the App accesses, how it is used, and your rights.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We <em>Do Not</em> Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The App stores all your expense entries (amount, vendor, description, date/time, project,
    receipt image, claimed status) <strong>locally</strong> on your device. We do <strong>not</strong>
    collect, transmit, or upload any of your personal or expense data to any server.
  </p>

  <h2>2. File & Image Storage</h2>
  <p>
    Receipt images you attach are saved in your app’s sandbox storage. When you perform a
    backup or export to CSV, those files are written to a folder you choose (e.g. <code>Download/Track_Expense/data</code>).
    Those CSV backups contain only the data you explicitly export—they are never shared automatically.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage access:</strong> to read/write your local database, receipt images, and backup files.</li>
    <li><strong>Camera/Gallery:</strong> optional, to let you pick or capture bill photos.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    No other permissions (location, contacts, microphone, internet) are requested.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Analytics & Ads</h2>
  <p>
    We do not include any analytics, advertising, or third-party tracking SDKs in the App.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>
    Your expense data resides only on your device. We recommend using your device’s
    built-in PIN or biometric lock to protect access. The App does not encrypt data at rest,
    so take standard precautions if you share or lose your device.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is rated “Everyone.” It does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will appear here
    with an updated “Last updated” date, and in the Play Store description where applicable.
  </p>
